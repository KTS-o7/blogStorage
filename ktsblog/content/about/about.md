> Hello! I'm **Krishnatejaswi S**, a passionate Computer Science and Engineering student from Bangalore, India. My journey in the world of technology has been both challenging and rewarding, and I'm excited to share my experiences and projects with you.

## Academic Background

- I'm currently pursuing my **B.E degree** in **Computer Science and Engineering** at **RV College of Engineering**, where I've had the opportunity to dive deep into various technologies and programming languages.
- My [**academic and research**](https://krishnatejaswi-s.vercel.app/#projects) projects have allowed me to explore and master languages like Python and C++, and I'm always eager to learn and experiment with new technologies.

## Portfolio

I've worked on a variety of projects that have helped me grow as a developer. Check out my [**portfolio**](https://krishnatejaswi-s.vercel.app/) to see some of my work. From web development to machine learning, I've tackled projects that challenge me and push my boundaries.

## Passion for Coding

My passion for coding extends beyond the classroom. I'm particularly interested in exploring the cutting-edge technologies that are shaping the future of the tech industry. Some of the areas I'm currently exploring include:

- **OpenCV**: A facinating library to work with image processing in python.
- **Ollama**: A platform that's revolutionizing the way we interact with AI.
- **Generative AI**: Creating content and models that can generate human-like text and images.
- **JavaScript, Next.js**: Building dynamic and responsive web applications.
- **PyTorch**: Diving into the world of machine learning and AI.
