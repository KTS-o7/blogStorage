# Ringcentral Interview Experience for SDE-1 (Oncampus)

## Eligibility Criteria

- `8.5+ CGPA`
- `Ciruit Branches`
- `No backlogs`
- `Batch of 2025`

## Qualification Round

This was an online test conducted on `HackerRank`. The test was of 90 minutes and had 2 sections:

### Section 1: MCQs

- This section had `5 MCQs`.
- Got questions from `Huffman encoding, Hamming code, Time complexity analysis`.
- There was a positive score for correct answers and **no** negative marking for wrong answers.

### Section 2: Coding

This section had 2 coding questions:
It was Leetcode `hard-medium` level questions. The set which I got had one graph based question and one Tree based question.
My Friends got questions from DP and graphs.

I was able to solve one question completely and the other question partially.

You can find link to similar questions [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-city-with-the-smallest-number-of-neighbors-at-a-threshold-distance/description/). This was very similar to the leetcode question 1334.
I have a detailed solution for the given question here - [Problem 1334](https://kts-o7.github.io/blog/posts/daily_lc/problem-1334-find-the-city-with-the-smallest-number-of-neighbours-at-a-threshold-distance/).

## Shortlisting

A total of 28 students were selected from online test into the inperson interviews.

## Interviews

The interviews were scheduled the very next day. There were 2 rounds of interviews.
We were asked to attend in formals along with hardcopy of resume.

1st round was purely technical while 2nd round was techno-managerial.

### Round 1

- Here the interviewer was kind and asked me to introduce myself.
- He then asked me to write code on paper for `interface` for a `stack` in any language of my choice.
- He then asked me to write code for `push`, `pop`, `peek` and `isEmpty` functions.
- I was able to write code for that. He then asked me to implement a `getMin` function which returns the minimum element in the stack in O(1) time.
- This was a question present in **Striver SDE Sheet**. I had done this question before so I was able to solve it.
- While doing this he asked me to explain the time complexity of the functions I wrote, how polymorphism works in the present code.

- You can find solution to that question over here - [Link](https://github.com/KTS-o7/CP_Notes/blob/main/Stack_Notes.md#1-designing-a-stack-that-supports-getmin-in-o1-time-and-o1-extra-space)

- He then asked me about cacheing and different algorithms used there. As I answered them, he asked me to implement LFU Cache.
- He gave me some hints and I was able to write the code for that.
- The next set of questions were from Operating Systems and Computernetworks.
  He asked me how `Interprocess Communication` works in OS and how `routing` and `subnetting` works in Computer Networks.
- There were also questions about deadlocks and reader-writer problems.
- I answered them and illustrated the usage of `semaphores` and `mutex` in solving them.

> I got shortlisted for the next round.

Number of students shortlisted for the next round - 13

### Round 2

- This round was more of resume based round.
- Interviewer asked me to introduce myself. Then asked me about my projects and internships.
- I explained thoroughly about the projects. He then asked me questions on various error codes in `HTTP` and asked me to explain how `SSL and TLS` works.
  I was able to explain both of them to a good level.
- He then asked two puzzles.
- The first puzzle is about optimization of number races to find winning horses among 25 horses. The problem link is here - [Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/puzzle-9-find-the-fastest-3-horses/)
- The second puzzle was to find the number of fishes to remove to change the percentage of fishes in a tank.
- This was a fairly easy ratio puzzle.
  I was able to solve both.
- Then I asked him about the company culture and the work environment. He explained it to me.
- I also asked about what are the learning opportunities in the company. He was excited to answer that.

> I cleared this round.

## Verdict

5 students were selected for the SDE-1 role. I was one of them. ( `Yay :)` )

## Tips

- Be prepared in fundamentals of Computer Science

  - Operating systems, Computer Networks, DBMS
  - Do good number of DSA problems

- Be very confident. I was able to clear both rounds because I was very comfortable to speak with them.
- You will think you aren’t prepared, but you already are! Just gain some confidence, it is very vital.
- Don’t hesitate to ask doubts to the interviewer, the more you interect, the more your chances are to get selected.
- Keep speaking out your thought process, the interviewer will provide you hints and encourage you to get to the answer.
- Be strng with your resume, stick to the every single ord mentioned in it.
- Always say YES if the interviewer asked you if you had any questions for him. (Do company research beforehand for this. Atleast read the JD.)
